Contributing
============

The `sonar-magik`-plugin is a work in progress and currently developed in my spare time. I cannot guarantee this project is bug-free and/or will work according to your expectations. You can contribute by using this plugin and report results.

For example:

- If you find any problems, have suggestions, or otherwise, report these at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/StevenLooman/sonar-swmagik/issues).
- If you report an issue, please report what is happening, expected result, actual result, used versions, etc.
- If you have a fix, please create pull request.
